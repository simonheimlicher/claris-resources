A Hugo partial that vastly improves resource management in Hugo sites by avoiding duplicate images in your content based on Page Bundles and Headless Bundles

This partial is designed for retrieving resources from a page bundle in Hugo, where resources refer to files like images, or data files. The partial is used for obtaining resources from Page Bundles, with a unique feature of traversing upwards to parent page bundles if the resource isnâ€™t found in the current page's bundle. This is especially useful for managing resources that are inherited on child pages or shared across multiple sections.

## Illustrative example

Let's consider the following example of a directory structure:

```zsh
content:
  articles:
    _index.md
    my-article:
      index.md
      images:
        feature-image.jpg
    images:
      index.md
      share-image.jpg
assets:
  images:
    logo.png
```

If you now use this partial in the file `content/articles/my-article/index.md`, you can access the three images by their relative paths.

### Accessing a feature image

As the feature image is specific to the article, it exists in the page bundle of the article `my-article`. We can access it using the following code:

```go-template
{{ $featureImage := partial "claris/_functions/resources/get" (dict 
        "Page" .
        "resource" "images/feature-image"
) }}
```

### Accessing a share image by traversing the file hierarchy

Now the share image might also be specific to the article, but in my case, I use the same share image for all articles. The share image hence only exists in the branch bundle of the articles section `articles`.

{{< note "Ensure to add `index.md` to turn the `images` directory into a headless bundle" >}}
Add a file named `index.md` with the following content into every `images` directory that is part of a branch bundle (see below for an explanation what a branch bundle is)

```yaml
---
headless: true
---
```

{{< /note >}}

If we have properly set up the `images` directory under `articles` as a headless bundle, we can access the share image `share-image.jpg` from the page bundle `my-article` using the following code:

```go-template
{{ $shareImage := partial "claris/_functions/resources/get" (dict 
        "Page" .
        "resource" "images/share-image"
) }}
```

Perhaps surprisingly, the call to the `resources` partial is almost the same, even though we will get an image from a headless bundle one level up.

### Accessing the logo image from the global `assets` folder

Finally, the site's logo image will be the same for all articles. Hence, it makes sense to either put it into a headless bundle at the top of the `content` directory, or into the `assets` directory. 

To access the share image, we use the following invocation of the `resources` partial:

```go-template
{{ $logoImage := partial "claris/_functions/resources/get" (dict 
        "Page" .
        "resource" "images/logo"
) }}
```

Again, the call to the `resources` partial is almost the same, even though we will get an image from the global `assets` directory.

## Basic usage

This partial accepts a dictionary with two key-value pairs: `Page` refers to the current page, while `$resourcePath` is the path of the resource. The path is treated as the prefix of the resource to be found, unless it ends with a file extension.

```markdown

{{ $resourcePath := "images/feature-image" }}
{{ $resourceArgs := (dict
"Page" .
"resource" $resourcePath
) }}

{{- $image := partial "claris/_functions/resources/get" $resourceArgs }}

```

#### Page Bundles in Hugo

Hugo categorizes Page Bundles into Leaf Bundles and Branch Bundles. Leaf Bundles are directories containing an `index.md` file and can include a variety of content and attachments for single pages. Branch Bundles, represented by `_index.md`, need to be used for sections and typically only contain non-page resources (source: [Hugo Page Bundles](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/)).

### Headless Bundles

For Branch Bundles, the partial employs a workaround using Headless Bundles. By adding `headless: true` to the front matter of an `index.md` file within a directory, the directory can host resources similarly to a Leaf Bundle (detailed at [Hugo Headless Bundles](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/#headless-bundle)).

### Parameters and Return Values

The partial uses the current page and the resource path as parameters, returning a Hugo resource object or `false` if not found.

### Resource Handling

Preference is given to page resources, with a fallback to site resources if the desired resource isn't found in the current page or its ancestors (source: [Hugo Page Resources](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-resources/)).

## Debugging Features

A `$debug` variable can be set to `true` for insights into the operational flow, aiding in troubleshooting and enhancements.

## How to Get This Partial

This partial is part of my Hugo module `claris-resources` and [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/simonheimlicher/claris-resources). To use it in your Hugo website, add the following to your `config/_default/hugo.yaml` (or `hugo.toml`) file:

```yaml
module:
  imports:
    - path: github.com/simonheimlicher/claris-resources
```

## Conclusion

This custom Hugo partial offers enhanced resource management, ensuring efficient resource utilization in Hugo websites. Its ability to navigate through different types of Page Bundles and leverage Headless Bundles for Branch Bundles is particularly valuable.
